# Distributed Chat Application

A chat application is a good starting point because it allows you to handle multiple clients, server-client communication, and real-time updates. Here are the key features of the system:

- Multiple Clients: Multiple users should be able to connect to the chat system from different machines.
- Server: The server will manage all the clients and handle the communication between them. It will broadcast messages to all clients.
- Real-time Communication: When a client sends a message, the server should distribute it to all other clients in real-time.
- User Authentication: Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and log out.

## System Design

Sketch out a design of your chat system. Identify the main components (server, client, etc.) and how they will interact.

## Setup RMI

Learn how to use Java RMI and set it up for your project. This will be the main technology that allows your server and clients to communicate.

## Implement the Server

The server will need to be able to accept connections from multiple clients, receive messages from clients, and send messages to all clients. Implement these features using Java RMI.

## Implement the Client

The client will need to connect to the server, send messages to the server, and receive messages from the server. Again, implement these features using Java RMI.

## User Authentication

Add a feature for users to create an account, log in, and log out. You can store user information in a simple file or use a database if you're comfortable with that.

## Testing

Test your system thoroughly before deploying it.
