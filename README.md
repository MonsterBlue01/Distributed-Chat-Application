# 10-Week Learning Plan for C# and AWS

This document outlines a 10-week plan for learning C# and AWS, while also reviewing Python, C, and C++ concepts.

## Week 1 - Introduction to C#

- Review the basics of data types, variables, and operators in Python, C, and C++.
- Compare these concepts to their counterparts in C#.

## Week 2 - Control Structures

- Review control structures in Python, C, and C++.
- Compare the syntax and use of these control structures in C#.

## Week 3 - Object-Oriented Programming

- Review classes and objects in Python and C++.
- Compare how classes and objects are defined and used in C#.
- Note: C is not an object-oriented language, so it doesn't have a direct comparison for this week.
- Start exploring AWS. Set up an account and familiarize yourself with the AWS Management Console.
- Learn about EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances and how to launch and connect to an instance.

## Week 4 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming

- Review abstract classes, interfaces, and generics in Python and C++.
- Compare these concepts to their equivalents in C#.
- Note: C doesn't have these concepts as it's not an object-oriented language.
- Learn about S3 (Simple Storage Service) and how to create a bucket, upload files, and set permissions.

## Week 5 - Data Structures and Collections

- Review data structures and collections in Python, C, and C++.
- Compare how these data structures are used in C#.
- Learn about DynamoDB, AWS's NoSQL database service. Create a table and perform basic operations (insert, update, delete, query).

## Week 6 - File I/O and Serialization

- Review file I/O and serialization in Python, C, and C++.
- Compare these concepts to their equivalents in C#.
- Learn about AWS Lambda, which lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- Write a simple Lambda function in C# or Python that reads from or writes to an S3 bucket.

## Week 7 - Databases

- Review how to connect to a database in Python and C++.
- Compare this to how you connect to a database in C#.
- Learn about RDS (Relational Database Service). Launch a database instance and connect to it.
- Compare RDS with using a local database in your applications.

## Week 8 - Multithreading and Asynchronous Programming

- Review multithreading and asynchronous programming in Python and C++.
- Compare these concepts to their equivalents in C#.
- Learn about SQS (Simple Queue Service) and SNS (Simple Notification Service). Understand how to use them for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

## Week 9 - Networking and Web Development Basics

- Review basics of creating web applications using Python frameworks like Flask or Django.
- Compare these to creating web applications using ASP.NET in C#.
- Learn about Elastic Beanstalk, AWS's platform as a service (PaaS) that can be used to deploy and scale web applications.
- Deploy a simple ASP.NET application to Elastic Beanstalk.

## Week 10 - Review and Project Work

- Review everything you've learned and compare the concepts across all languages.
- Start a small project in C# and consider how you would have approached it in Python, C, and C++.
- Review the AWS services you've learned about.
- Incorporate these services into your C# project. This could involve storing data in DynamoDB or RDS, processing data with Lambda, deploying your application with Elastic Beanstalk, and more.
